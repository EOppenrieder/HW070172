  abstract = {Many Western scholars and foreign-policy makers have lauded the Congress of Vienna, Metternich's ``Concert of Europe,'' and Prussian chancellor Otto von Bismarck's alliance system for keeping a ``long peace'' from 1815 to 1914. The superiority of nineteenth-century statecraft is a myth. Europe was busy at war between 1815 and 1914, if not in conflicts on the scale of the Napoleonic Wars and World War I. Furthermore, the chancelleries of nineteenth-century Europe not only quelled national uprisings, but suppressed peoples' political rights and waged imperial wars throughout Africa and Asia. From the perspective of a Pole, a disenfranchised European, or an Indian, the century was not a ``long peace'' but a ``long war.''},
