  abstract = {The Bohemian aristocracy in the late nineteenth century has long been neglected by historians. This essay intends to draw attention to research on the history of the Bohemian aristocracy between the revolution of 1848 and the end of the First World War, respectively the Czechoslovak land reform in 1921. Geographically, the focus is on research done in the Czech Republic, but studies from Germany, Austria, and North America are taken into account as well. A substantial number of books and articles discusses the aristocracy with cultural history approaches, focussing, e.g., on family, language and representations. A further, much-debated issue is the relationship between the so-called feudal-conservative wing of the aristocracy and the Czech national movement. Contrary to research on early modern times, a synthesis is still to be awaited.},
