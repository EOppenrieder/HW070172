  abstract: Rural credit in the Bohemian crown lands of the Habsburg monarchy became
    available on a wide scale only after the abolition of serfdom in 1848. Although
    organized to serve municipal interests, savings banks and Schulze-Delitzsch credit
    cooperatives initially provided rural credit, primarily in the form of mortgage
    loans. Such local financial institutions embraced a social mission of aiding the
    poor and promoting small producers, while seeking to encourage economic modernization
    and Czech national revival. Strengthening the economic position of small agricultural
    producers fit in with both the socioeconomic and national motives of local financial
    institutions in the 1860s and 1870s. With the agricultural depression of the 1880s,
    however, agrarian leaders criticized credit cooperatives and savings banks for
    promoting urban interests over those of their rural customers, and new financial
    institutions, particularly Raiffeisen-type cooperatives, were founded in the 1890s
    and 1900s to better meet the credit needs of small farmers. These new cooperatives
    contributed to the growing political and economic integration of the peasantry
    into the Czech national life.

anderson_metternich_2007:
  abstract: Many Western scholars and foreign-policy makers have lauded the Congress
    of Vienna, Metternich's ``Concert of Europe,'' and Prussian chancellor Otto von
    Bismarck's alliance system for keeping a ``long peace'' from 1815 to 1914. The
    superiority of nineteenth-century statecraft is a myth. Europe was busy at war
    between 1815 and 1914, if not in conflicts on the scale of the Napoleonic Wars
    and World War I. Furthermore, the chancelleries of nineteenth-century Europe not
    only quelled national uprisings, but suppressed peoples' political rights and
    waged imperial wars throughout Africa and Asia. From the perspective of a Pole,
    a disenfranchised European, or an Indian, the century was not a ``long peace''
    but a ``long war.''

krajkowski_chasing_2015:
  abstract: The main aim of the article is to examine various views of the problem
    of progress and backwardness presented in Polish writings on Galicia during the
    second half of the 19th century. At this time Galicia was considered as one of
    the most backward regions of Europe, and this state of affairs was also noticed
    by Polish journalists, scientists, politicians and writers connected with Austrian
    partition of former Poland. However, it does not mean that the diagnoses as well
    as recipes for economic growth were concurrent. To the contrary, significant differences
    can be found between views on the development of Galicia. Moreover, these opinions
    changed over time. This article is an attempt to trace the evolution of these
    ideas, which was parallel to the changes in the situation of the province. The
    author does not present a complete picture of the problem of backwardness in multicultural
    Galicia, but he focuses on Polish writings, as a product of the politically dominant
    culture of the province.

kucera_marginalizing_2012:
  abstract: The study concentrates on the pre-1848 labor protests in Bohemia and analyzes
    them with respect to questions of gender. It reviews the current historiography
    on the topic, focusing mainly on the English example. Here some of the recent
    key debates within the field of labor history have been held, arguing that working-class
    action in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries was shaped by a gender
    composite working-class culture that was inherently both masculine and feminine.
    Taking these debates as a yardstick, the paper explores how the codes and institutions
    of skilled labor masculinity shaped working-class collective action in pre-1848
    Bohemia. Bohemia was, the study argues, one of the most industrialized regions
    next to England and France during the first half of the nineteenth century and
    also produced a significant amount of collective labor protests. The paper analyzes
    these protests in terms of their gender structure and compares this structure
    with the gender composition of the respective labor force. It comes to the conclusion
    that while the qualified labor force of the Bohemian textile industry, which generated
    the overall majority of all unrests, was gender-mixed, its protests were predominantly
    carried out by a crowd consisting only of men. The explanation for this discrepancy
    is found in the Bohemian working-class culture, which was shaped by male-friendly
    societies and brotherhoods. These brotherhoods constituted the institutional arena
    for the emergence of working-class masculinity, which went on to dominate the
    entire working-class culture and hence shaped the majority of collective protests
    as well.

mosle_verfassungsautonomie_1994:
  abstract: The ministerial conference in Vienna in the winter of 1819/20 is considered
    a great success for the Austrian prime minister Metternich. By propagating the
    "monarchische Prinzip" (monarchical principle) and the other regulations of the
    "Wiener Schlu\ss akte" (Vienna Final Act, Art. 54-61) concerning Art. 13 of the
    "Bundesakte" (Federal Act), he succeeded in decisively limiting and weakening
    the constitutional movement in the German states. A new view and interpretation
    of Art. 54-61 leads to the conclusion that they not only contain the "monarchische
    Prinzip" (monarchical principle), but at the same time, the final recognition
    of the representative constitution which was to be later abolished at the conferences
    of Carlsbad only a few months ago. The representative constitutions of the south
    German states had been welcomed enthusiastically in public as modern constitutions.

sedivy_adrianople_2011-1:
  abstract: Relying on a thorough examination of relevant archival documents housed
    in several European archives, this paper analyses Austrian Chancellor Metternich's
    Near Eastern policy from 1829 to 1833 with special attention paid to Austria's
    relations with Russia. Its primary goal is to refute some already deep-rooted
    claims relating to Metternich's attitudes towards Russia and the Ottoman Empire
    from 1829 to 1833 and to offer a different assessment of his role in the diplomatic
    concert to the one generally held by proving firstly that Metternich did not fear
    Russia's policy towards the Ottoman Empire during this period, secondly that his
    policy was consistent and the meeting in M\"unchengr\"atz in 1833 was not such
    an important turning point in the Austrian\textemdash Russian relations but simply
    the climax of the already existing good relationship between the two conservative
    Powers, and, finally, that no Austro-Russian quid pro quo was agreed upon in this
    North Bohemian town, which means that Metternich did not have to give up Austrian
    interests in the Near East for the Russian support in the West because both countries'
    interests in the two areas were identical. Finally, the paper attempts to point
    out the fact that though Metternich's policy definitely was conservative, it cannot
    be sufficiently explained by such a superficial single-word labelling because
    much of his rationality based upon an in-depth analysis of the affairs lay beyond
    it, at least of those issues concerning the Eastern Question in the early 1830s.

  abstract: The second Ottoman-Egyptian crisis from 1839 to 1841 was one of the most
    important chapters in the history of the Eastern question. At that time, the fragile
    structure of the Ottoman Empire trembled in its foundations under the pressure
    of the ambitious, powerful Egyptian governor, Mohammed Ali, who at the end of
    the 1830s controlled Egypt along with Sudan, Crete, a considerable part of the
    Arabian Peninsula, and even Syria. Although formally he was the sultan's subject
    administering some Ottoman provinces, in reality Mohammed Ali governed his dominions
    as an independent ruler, hence dividing the Ottoman Empire into two parts, one
    of them ruled from Constantinople and the other from Alexandria. The sultan's
    attempt to terminate the existence of this dual system ended in disaster; and
    in the midsummer of 1839, the empire found itself without its army, navy, and
    monarch, who died at the end of June.

    of reform in the Ottoman Empire and the reasons for his interest and practical
    steps taken in this matter. The paper attempts to provide an accurate account
    of an important, but until now, entirely ignored, aspect of Metternich's diplomacy
    and offer further proof that Metternich was not the benighted reactionary depicted
    in the nineteenth-century historiography, but a conservative keenly aware that
    the conservative order could survive only if reformed so as to adapt it to the
    realities of a post-revolutionary age.

sofka_metternichs_1998:
  abstract: This article examines the foreign policy of Prince Clemens Metternich
    of Austria, the chief architect of the Vienna Treaty of 1815, in the light of
    Enlightenment political thought. Metternich is commonly considered a reactionary
    and practitioner of callous balance-of-power diplomacy, and this article seeks
    to refute this conclusion. By examining Metternich's deeply held theoretical beliefs
    on the nature of the European state system, and above all his Kantian belief in
    progress and federalism, this essay concludes that Metternich pursued a reformist,
    and indeed idealistic, program in international politics which cannot be divorced
    from late Enlightenment philosophy. His Conference System, which was designed
    to regulate European politics in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars, represented
    a novel experiment in European union which remains a pressing concern in the contemporary
    international system.

  abstract: One can find many examples of how growing anti-Jewish sentiments or anti-Semitic
    propaganda triggered anti-Jewish pogroms (e.g., Father Stoja\l owski's activities
    in West Galicia and the pogroms of 1898).{$^1$ Yet increasingly in scholarly literature
    attempts have been made to distinguish between conflicts and the outbreaks of
    violence, seeing such outbreaks as not primarily the result of a conflict but
    rather as themselves a specific type of conflict\textemdash ``as a form of social
    or political action in [their] own right.''{$^2$ As Rogers Brubaker and David

  abstract: Based on an analysis of chief programmatic texts from the period of the
    Croatian National Revival and the Croatian Political Movement of 1848-1849, as
    well as articles published in Zagreb liberal newspapers, this paper illustrates
    how the Croatian intellectual elite advocated political rights and freedoms in
    the first half of the nineteenth century. Following the tradition of the Enlightenment,
    the elite interpreted them as natural rights. While the focus in the first decades
    of the nineteenth century was on the idea of enlightening the people and the right
    of the people to nurture their native language, in the 1840s other rights were
    also included. In the revolutionary year of 1848, the formulation of political
    rights and freedoms was most complete.

  abstract: The Bohemian aristocracy in the late nineteenth century has long been
    neglected by historians. This essay intends to draw attention to research on the
    history of the Bohemian aristocracy between the revolution of 1848 and the end
    of the First World War, respectively the Czechoslovak land reform in 1921. Geographically,
    the focus is on research done in the Czech Republic, but studies from Germany,
    Austria, and North America are taken into account as well. A substantial number
    of books and articles discusses the aristocracy with cultural history approaches,
    focussing, e.g., on family, language and representations. A further, much-debated
    issue is the relationship between the so-called feudal-conservative wing of the
    aristocracy and the Czech national movement. Contrary to research on early modern
    times, a synthesis is still to be awaited.

wolff_kennst_2008:
  abstract: During the Napoleonic wars the future existence of Habsburg Galicia was
    regarded as uncertain, and in the period following the Congress of Vienna the
    identity of the province was likewise unclear. The eighteenth-century creation
    of Galicia gave way to the nineteenth-century attempt to create Galicians and
    to discover a non-national provincial meaning of "Galicia," capable of reconciling
    and transcending national, religious, and linguistic differences. In this article
    Larry Wolff juxtaposes the political perspective of Metternich and the literary
    perspective of dramatist Aleksander Fredro in order to analyze the imperial and
    provincial dynamics of the idea of Galicia, with further attention to the public
    sphere of newspapers and journals, and the cultural perspectives of Galicians
    like Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart (the son of the great composer) and J\'ozef Maksymilian
    Ossoli\'nski (founder of the Ossolineum library in Lviv). This article traces
    the evolving cultural meanings of Galicia up until 1835, the year of the death
    of Habsburg Emperor Franz and the year that Fredro was denounced by a Polish critic
    as a "non-national" writer. Especially in Fredro's celebrated comedies, it is
    possible to discern the submerged ideological tensions of empire and province
    that shaped Galician identity in the early nineteenth century.
