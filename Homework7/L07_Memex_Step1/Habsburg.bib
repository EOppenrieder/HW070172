  abstract = {Rural credit in the Bohemian crown lands of the Habsburg monarchy became available on a wide scale only after the abolition of serfdom in 1848. Although organized to serve municipal interests, savings banks and Schulze-Delitzsch credit cooperatives initially provided rural credit, primarily in the form of mortgage loans. Such local financial institutions embraced a social mission of aiding the poor and promoting small producers, while seeking to encourage economic modernization and Czech national revival. Strengthening the economic position of small agricultural producers fit in with both the socioeconomic and national motives of local financial institutions in the 1860s and 1870s. With the agricultural depression of the 1880s, however, agrarian leaders criticized credit cooperatives and savings banks for promoting urban interests over those of their rural customers, and new financial institutions, particularly Raiffeisen-type cooperatives, were founded in the 1890s and 1900s to better meet the credit needs of small farmers. These new cooperatives contributed to the growing political and economic integration of the peasantry into the Czech national life.},

The superiority of nineteenth-century statecraft is a myth. Europe was busy at war between 1815 and 1914, if not in conflicts on the scale of the Napoleonic Wars and World War I. Furthermore, the chancelleries of nineteenth-century Europe not only quelled national uprisings, but suppressed peoples' political rights and waged imperial wars throughout Africa and Asia. From the perspective of a Pole, a disenfranchised European, or an Indian, the century was not a ``long peace'' but a ``long war.''},

At this time Galicia was considered as one of the most backward regions of Europe, and this state of affairs was also noticed by Polish journalists, scientists, politicians and writers connected with Austrian partition of former Poland. However, it does not mean that the diagnoses as well as recipes for economic growth were concurrent. To the contrary, significant differences can be found between views on the development of Galicia. Moreover, these opinions changed over time. This article is an attempt to trace the evolution of these ideas, which was parallel to the changes in the situation of the province. The author does not present a complete picture of the problem of backwardness in multicultural Galicia, but he focuses on Polish writings, as a product of the politically dominant culture of the province.},

It reviews the current historiography on the topic, focusing mainly on the English example. Here some of the recent key debates within the field of labor history have been held, arguing that working-class action in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries was shaped by a gender composite working-class culture that was inherently both masculine and feminine. Taking these debates as a yardstick, the paper explores how the codes and institutions of skilled labor masculinity shaped working-class collective action in pre-1848 Bohemia. Bohemia was, the study argues, one of the most industrialized regions next to England and France during the first half of the nineteenth century and also produced a significant amount of collective labor protests. The paper analyzes these protests in terms of their gender structure and compares this structure with the gender composition of the respective labor force. It comes to the conclusion that while the qualified labor force of the Bohemian textile industry, which generated the overall majority of all unrests, was gender-mixed, its protests were predominantly carried out by a crowd consisting only of men. The explanation for this discrepancy is found in the Bohemian working-class culture, which was shaped by male-friendly societies and brotherhoods. These brotherhoods constituted the institutional arena for the emergence of working-class masculinity, which went on to dominate the entire working-class culture and hence shaped the majority of collective protests as well.},

Its primary goal is to refute some already deep-rooted claims relating to Metternich's attitudes towards Russia and the Ottoman Empire from 1829 to 1833 and to offer a different assessment of his role in the diplomatic concert to the one generally held by proving firstly that Metternich did not fear Russia's policy towards the Ottoman Empire during this period, secondly that his policy was consistent and the meeting in M\"unchengr\"atz in 1833 was not such an important turning point in the Austrian\textemdash Russian relations but simply the climax of the already existing good relationship between the two conservative Powers, and, finally, that no Austro-Russian quid pro quo was agreed upon in this North Bohemian town, which means that Metternich did not have to give up Austrian interests in the Near East for the Russian support in the West because both countries' interests in the two areas were identical. Finally, the paper attempts to point out the fact that though Metternich's policy definitely was conservative, it cannot be sufficiently explained by such a superficial single-word labelling because much of his rationality based upon an in-depth analysis of the affairs lay beyond it, at least of those issues concerning the Eastern Question in the early 1830s.},

Although formally he was the sultan's subject administering some Ottoman provinces, in reality Mohammed Ali governed his dominions as an independent ruler, hence dividing the Ottoman Empire into two parts, one of them ruled from Constantinople and the other from Alexandria. The sultan's attempt to terminate the existence of this dual system ended in disaster; and in the midsummer of 1839, the empire found itself without its army, navy, and monarch, who died at the end of June.},

By examining Metternich's deeply held theoretical beliefs on the nature of the European state system, and above all his Kantian belief in progress and federalism, this essay concludes that Metternich pursued a reformist, and indeed idealistic, program in international politics which cannot be divorced from late Enlightenment philosophy. His Conference System, which was designed to regulate European politics in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars, represented a novel experiment in European union which remains a pressing concern in the contemporary international system.},

Following the tradition of the Enlightenment, the elite interpreted them as natural rights. While the focus in the first decades of the nineteenth century was on the idea of enlightening the people and the right of the people to nurture their native language, in the 1840s other rights were also included. In the revolutionary year of 1848, the formulation of political rights and freedoms was most complete.},

This essay intends to draw attention to research on the history of the Bohemian aristocracy between the revolution of 1848 and the end of the First World War, respectively the Czechoslovak land reform in 1921. Geographically, the focus is on research done in the Czech Republic, but studies from Germany, Austria, and North America are taken into account as well. A substantial number of books and articles discusses the aristocracy with cultural history approaches, focussing, e.g., on family, language and representations. A further, much-debated issue is the relationship between the so-called feudal-conservative wing of the aristocracy and the Czech national movement. Contrary to research on early modern times, a synthesis is still to be awaited.},

  abstract = {During the Napoleonic wars the future existence of Habsburg Galicia was regarded as uncertain, and in the period following the Congress of Vienna the identity of the province was likewise unclear. The eighteenth-century creation of Galicia gave way to the nineteenth-century attempt to create Galicians and to discover a non-national provincial meaning of "Galicia," capable of reconciling and transcending national, religious, and linguistic differences. In this article Larry Wolff juxtaposes the political perspective of Metternich and the literary perspective of dramatist Aleksander Fredro in order to analyze the imperial and provincial dynamics of the idea of Galicia, with further attention to the public sphere of newspapers and journals, and the cultural perspectives of Galicians like Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart (the son of the great composer) and J\'ozef Maksymilian Ossoli\'nski (founder of the Ossolineum library in Lviv). This article traces the evolving cultural meanings of Galicia up until 1835, the year of the death of Habsburg Emperor Franz and the year that Fredro was denounced by a Polish critic as a "non-national" writer. Especially in Fredro's celebrated comedies, it is possible to discern the submerged ideological tensions of empire and province that shaped Galician identity in the early nineteenth century.},
